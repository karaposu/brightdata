When to pick which
If you just need to slow things down so your one CDP session doesnâ€™t choke, use a semaphore on top of the single-connection BrowserAPI.

If you need higher total throughput and are willing to pay for a handful of extra CDP sessions, use a pool of BrowserAPI instances.

You can also combine them: make a pool of, say, 4 CDP sessions, and put a semaphore of 8 around each session so you never push more than 8 in parallel per session.
