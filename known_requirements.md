# BrightData SDK - Known Requirements

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Core Scraping Infrastructure**
   - Base scraper class with async/sync support
   - Registry system for automatic scraper discovery
   - URL auto-detection and routing
   - Comprehensive error handling and result objects

2. **Specialized Scrapers**
   - Amazon (products, reviews, sellers, search)
   - LinkedIn (profiles, companies, jobs)
   - Instagram (posts, profiles, hashtags)
   - TikTok (videos, profiles)
   - X/Twitter (tweets, profiles)
   - Reddit (posts, comments)
   - DigiKey & Mouser (electronic components)

3. **Scraping Methods**
   - Web Unlocker integration
   - Browser API with Playwright support
   - Fallback mechanisms between methods
   - Concurrency strategies (noop, semaphore, pool)

4. **Async Operations**
   - Native asyncio support throughout
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Efficient polling mechanisms
   - Thread-based workers for sync environments

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Type hints for all public APIs
   - Comprehensive result objects with metrics
   - Cost tracking and reporting
   - Simple one-line interface (`scrape_url`)

## 📋 Current Requirements & TODOs

### High Priority

1. **Web Unlocker Integration**
   - ❌ Make web unlocker return a proper `ScrapeResult` object (currently returns different format)
   - ❌ Add web unlocker fallback mechanism for `scrape_url` method
   - ❌ Standardize cost calculation across all methods

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - ❌ Better error messages for common failures
   - ❌ Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - ❌ Circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ❌ Connection pooling for Web Unlocker
   - ❌ Response caching with TTL
   - ❌ Batch request optimization

### Medium Priority

4. **Additional Scrapers**
   - ❌ YouTube scraper (currently in planned_scrapers/)
   - ❌ GitHub scraper (currently in planned_scrapers/)
   - ❌ Google Search results
   - ❌ Yelp business listings
   - ❌ Indeed job postings

5. **Enhanced Features**
   - ❌ Proxy rotation support
   - ❌ Custom headers and cookies
   - ❌ Session persistence
   - ❌ Screenshot capture capability

6. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - ❌ Structured logging
   - ❌ Metrics collection (success rates, response times)
   - ❌ Health check endpoints
   - ❌ Usage analytics

### Low Priority

7. **Documentation**
   - ❌ API reference documentation
   - ❌ More code examples
   - ❌ Video tutorials
   - ❌ Migration guide from official SDK

8. **Testing**
   - ❌ Integration test suite
   - ❌ Mock BrightData API for testing
   - ❌ Performance benchmarks
   - ❌ Load testing tools

9. **Tooling**
   - ❌ CLI tool for quick scraping
   - ❌ GUI for configuration
   - ❌ VS Code extension
   - ❌ Jupyter notebook integration

## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**
   - Multiple old/deprecated files (old_scraper.py, old_tests.py)
   - Inconsistent naming conventions
   - Duplicate code between scrapers

2. **API Consistency**
   - Different return types for sync vs async methods
   - Inconsistent parameter names across scrapers
   - Mixed camelCase and snake_case

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Limited unit test coverage
   - No automated integration tests
   - Manual testing process

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **AI/ML Integration**
   - Automatic data extraction without predefined patterns
   - Content classification
   - Quality scoring for scraped data

2. **Advanced Scheduling**
   - Cron-based scraping
   - Rate limit management
   - Priority queues

3. **Data Pipeline**
   - Built-in data validation
   - Format conversion (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
   - Direct database integration

4. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-tenant support
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging
   - SLA guarantees

## 📊 Performance Requirements

- Handle 10,000+ concurrent scraping jobs
- Sub-second response time for cached content
- 99.9% uptime for critical scrapers
- Memory usage under 1GB for typical workloads

## 🔒 Security Requirements

- Secure credential storage
- API key rotation
- Rate limiting per user/tenant
- Input sanitization
- HTTPS everywhere

## 📱 Platform Support

- Python 3.7+ compatibility
- Linux, macOS, Windows support
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Serverless function compatibility

## 📈 Scalability Requirements

- Horizontal scaling support
- Queue-based job distribution
- Distributed caching
- Multi-region deployment

## Dependencies to Address

- Reduce dependency footprint
- Optional dependencies for specific features
- Version pinning for stability
- Security vulnerability scanning

This requirements document should be updated as features are implemented and new needs are identified.
